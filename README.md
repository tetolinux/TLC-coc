## Community Conduct
**1. Respect everyone.**  
No harassment, slurs, bullying, or personal attacks.  

**2. Keep discussions civil.**  
Challenge ideas, not people. Heated debates are fine — disrespect is not.  

**3. No cross-server drama.**  

**4. Be inclusive.**  
Everyone is welcome regardless of experience level, background, or opinion.  

**5. Respect privacy.**  
Don’t share personal details (yours or others) without consent.  

**6. No impersonation.**  
Don’t pose as staff, bots, or other members.  

**7. Encourage learning.**  
Support beginners instead of putting them down.

**8. Keep it on-topic.**  
Linux, or any tech related conversations belong in their proper channels.  

**9. Use off-topic channels.**  
Casual chat, memes, or non-tech talk go there — not in support/linux areas.  

**10. No spam.**  
Don’t flood messages, walls of emojis, or low-effort posts.  

**11. No advertising.**  
Unsolicited promotions, invites, or links aren’t allowed.  

**12. Keep content safe.**  
No NSFW, extreme violence, shock, or disturbing material.  

**13. No piracy.**  
Don’t share or request cracked software, illegal files, or instructions for them.  

**14. No malicious material.**  
No malware, exploits, backdoors, or anything harmful.  

**15. Share responsibly.**  
Don’t post misleading info, unverified downloads, or unsafe commands.

## Server Rules
**16. Use the correct channels.**  
Help keep the server clean and organized.  

**17. Don’t mini-mod.**  
Report issues instead of trying to act as staff.  

**18. English is the default.**  
Unless otherwise stated, keep conversations in English.  

**19. Respect staff decisions.**  
Moderators have the final say — appeals can be made respectfully.

Our rules add to Discord’s official guidelines, not replace them.
