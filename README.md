# Teto Linux Community â€“ Rules & Guidelines

Welcome to the Teto Linux Community!

This space is a place for learning, sharing, and having fun with Linux and open-source software.

To make it a safe, useful, and enjoyable place for everyone, please follow these rules:

---

## Community Conduct

**1. Respect everyone.**
No harassment, slurs, bullying, or personal attacks.

**2. Keep discussions civil.**
Challenge ideas, not people. Heated debates are fine, but disrespect is not.

**3. No cross-server drama.**

**4. Be inclusive.**
Everyone is welcome, regardless of their experience level, background, or opinion.

**5. Respect privacy.**
Do not share personal details (yours or others') without consent.

**6. No impersonation.**
Do not pretend to be staff, bots, or other members.

**7. Encourage learning.**
Support beginners instead of making them feel inferior.

---

**8. Keep it on-topic.**
Linux or any tech-related conversations should be in their designated channels.

**9. Use off-topic channels.**
Casual chat, memes, or non-tech topics should be in these channels, not in the support or Linux areas.

**10. No spam.**
Do not flood the server with messages, walls of emojis, or low-effort posts.

**11. No advertising.**
Unsolicited promotions, invites, or links are not allowed.

**12. Keep content safe.**
No NSFW, extreme violence, shock, or disturbing material.

**13. No piracy.**
Do not share or request cracked software, illegal files, or instructions for them.

**14. No malicious material.**
No malware, exploits, backdoors, or anything harmful.

**15. Share responsibly.**
Do not post misleading information, unverified downloads, or unsafe commands.

---

**16. Use the correct channels.**
Help keep the server clean and organized.

**17. Don't mini-mod.**
Report issues instead of trying to act as staff.

**18. English is the default.**
Unless otherwise stated, keep conversations in English.

**19. Respect staff decisions.**
Moderators have the final say, but appeals can be made respectfully.

**20. Follow Discord's ToS.**
Our rules should complement Discord's official guidelines, not replace them.
